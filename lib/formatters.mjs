/*
 * formatters — the curated formatter contract of the abap2UI5 frontend.
 *
 * The framework ships ONE formatter module (app/webapp/model/formatter.js,
 * registered as `z2ui5/model/formatter` and published as the `z2ui5.Formatter`
 * global). Its export surface is deliberately tiny and machine-gated upstream
 * (.github/scripts/formatter-scope-gate.mjs): a function is admitted only when
 * it formats exactly the value handed to it AND there is a technical reason it
 * cannot be done in ABAP (a JS type the JSON model cannot carry, an icon-font
 * glyph, a locale/theme artefact). Everything else is backend work — computed
 * in ABAP, bound as a finished field.
 *
 * Precedent, so the line is not re-litigated here either: weightState /
 * weightStateByValue and the demo-kit pack (round2DP, dimensions,
 * stockStatusState, stockStatusIcon, deliveryStatusState) were shipped and
 * then REMOVED upstream — which silently broke the samples that used them,
 * because UI5 resolves a formatter string at binding time and an unknown name
 * simply yields no value. That failure mode is exactly what the
 * `uncurated-formatter` rule exists for.
 *
 * This list is hand-maintained against the upstream module, like
 * frontend-actions.mjs is against the z2ui5_cl_ui5f_*_js action classes. The render
 * harness (lib/render.mjs) mirrors the same four functions; a test keeps the
 * two in step.
