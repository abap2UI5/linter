/*
 * fix — apply the fixes a finding brought with it.
 *
 * A rule attaches `fixes: [{ start, end, text }]` — exact character spans in
 * the source it was given — when, and only when, the correction is
 * mechanical: the same call with the current method name, a missing `$`, a
 * bare boolean token wrapped, a call that provably does nothing deleted. A
 * rule whose correction needs a decision (which
 * of two duplicate attributes survives, what event a `_bind` on an event slot
 * should raise) deliberately carries none: a fix that has to guess is worse
 * than a finding that stays.
 *
 * Suppression happens before this: `--fix` works off the findings that
 * survived the `rules` block and the source directives, so a waived line is
 * never rewritten.
