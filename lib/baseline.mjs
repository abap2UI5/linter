/*
 * baseline — adopt the linter on a repo that already has findings.
 *
 * Switching a linter on over an existing codebase produces everything at
 * once, and the only escapes so far lost information: `rules: false` switches
 * a rule off wholesale, a directive touches every line. The baseline is the
 * third way, the one abaplint and this ecosystem's own pattern-lint use: a
 * committed file that says "these findings existed when we adopted the
 * linter". Baselined findings are suppressed (counted, never listed), NEW
 * findings fail normally — so the debt is frozen, not ignored.
 *
 * The key is deliberately line-free (`file|rule|control|member|value` with a
 * COUNT per key): moving code around does not invalidate the baseline, only
 * fixing or adding a finding changes it. File paths in the keys are relative
 * to the BASELINE FILE's directory, not to whatever cwd a run happens to
 * have — so the CLI from any directory, the Action and the VS Code extension
 * all compute identical keys. A STALE entry — one no current finding matches
 * — FAILS the run, the same contract every declared skip in this ecosystem
 * has: a suppression can never quietly outlive what it was suppressing.
 * `--update-baseline` rewrites the file from the current state.
 *
 * Render errors are not baselineable: their message text is unstable and
 * `rules['render-error']` already waives them per file.
