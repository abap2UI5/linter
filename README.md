# abap2UI5-linter

**Validate abap2UI5 app classes without an SAP system** — a CLI, library, and
GitHub Action extracted from the CI gates of
[samples-controls](https://github.com/abap2UI5/samples-controls), where they guard 416
generated ports of the official UI5 demo kit samples.

It checks a **whole app class**, not just the XML it emits: the ABAP source
and the view it builds are validated together. The defects that matter most
are the ones living between the two — a bound attribute whose ABAP field does
not exist, an event argument the control never delivers — and no UI5 tooling
can see them, because the view only exists at runtime.

Two gates:

1. **Property gate** — everything the view writes is resolved against a UI5
   metadata snapshot (988 controls with their full member lists and types,
   219 enums, generated from the OpenUI5 sources). It reports:

   | Finding | Example |
   | --- | --- |
   | `unknown-control` | `sap.m.Shell2` — no such control |
   | `unknown-property` | `Button typ="…"` — no such property/event/association |
   | `invalid-property-value` | `Button type="Emphasised"` — outside `sap.m.ButtonType`; also non-numeric `int`/`float` and non-boolean values |
   | `unknown-aggregation` | `Page contentt` — no such aggregation |
   | `too-many-children` | two controls in a 0..1 aggregation |
   | `invalid-aggregation-child` | a control the aggregation's type does not accept |
   | `control-too-new` / `member-too-new` | introduced after your target UI5 version (default **1.71**) |
   | `enum-value-too-new` | the property is old, the VALUE is not — `GenericTile frameType="OneByHalf"` is @since 1.83 on a 1.71 target; the snapshot keeps the per-value `@since` from the enum's JSDoc |
   | `aggregation-too-new` | an aggregation **tag** introduced after your target — `<footer>` on a `Dialog` is ~1.110, and unlike a too-new property it does not get dropped: UI5 resolves the lowercase tag as a control class and the 404 on `sap/m/footer.js` takes the **whole view** down. Use `buttons` (1.21.1) |
   | `event-parameter-too-new` | a `${$parameters>/name}` read back in a `t_arg` that the event only gained later — resolved per event, not per name |
   | `unknown-icon` | `sap-icon://textFormatting` — a glyph the font has in **no** release. `IconPool` reads the name as a URI hostname, which is lower-cased, so a camelCase name is not "nearly right": it matches nothing, forever (the name is `text-formatting`) |
   | `icon-too-new` | the glyph reached the font after your target — `information` in 1.80 (use `message-information`), `clear-all` in 1.86 (use `eraser`). An unknown icon is **not** an error in UI5: the control simply renders with no icon and nothing is logged |
   | `icon-removed` | the glyph left the font again — `binary` (1.104) is `non-binary` from 1.120 on, same codepoint, renamed |
   | `toolbar-control-in-bar` | a `ToolbarSpacer`/`ToolbarSeparator` inside a `sap.m.Bar` — before 1.76 a Bar lays its children out in normal flow, so the block-level child starts a new line and the bar's `overflow: hidden` **deletes every sibling after it**. Includes `Page headerContent`, which is forwarded into the internal Bar |
   | `unknown-event-parameter` | a `${$parameters>/typo}` the event does not declare — the value usually arrives **empty**. Judged only against an event the control declares itself; a hint, because a control can fire more than its metadata declares |
   | `control-deprecated` / `member-deprecated` | control or property already deprecated at your target version |
   | `duplicate-aggregation` | the same aggregation opened twice under one control — the second tag replaces the first |
   | `aggregation-in-aggregation` | an aggregation directly inside another one — invalid XML, and the signature of a missing `shut( )`: UI5 then goes looking for a control class by that name |
   | `excess-shut` | one `shut( )` more than the builder tree is deep — asserts at runtime |
   | `duplicate-property` | the same attribute written twice on one control — the view builder asserts on it |
   | `attribute-without-element` | `a( )` on the bare factory root — nothing to attach it to, asserts too |
   | `source-line-too-long` | a source line over **255** characters — the class does not fail to lint, it fails to *import*: abapGit reports the error for that object and carries on, so an **empty class stub** stays behind in the system. Split the literal into `&&` chunks (and fix the generator, if the file is generated) |
   | `duplicate-id` | the same `id` twice — duplicate-ID error at runtime |
   | `undeclared-namespace` | `ns = 'form'` without an `xmlns:form` |
   | `display-root-mismatch` | a `mvc:View` handed to `popup_display( )`, or a `core:FragmentDefinition` to `view_display( )` — the slot decides whether the client uses `XMLView.create` or `Fragment.load` |
   | `invalid-expression-binding` | unbalanced braces/parens in `{= … }` |
   | `sapui5-only-control` | needs SAPUI5, absent from OpenUI5 (see below) |
   | `missing-required-aggregation` | a `Table` bound to rows but given no `columns` — renders empty |
   | `collection-bound-to-property` | a table/structure bound to a scalar property |
   | `settable-property-via-action` | a `CONTROL_BY_ID` `set…( )` on a control that has a bindable property of that name — bind it two-way instead |
   | `relative-binding-without-context` | a relative `{FIELD}` on a control outside any bound aggregation — it resolves against nothing and the control renders empty |
   | `frontend-action-unknown-id` | an id-addressed wire (`CONTROL_BY_ID`, `SET_FOCUS`, `SCROLL_TO`, `SCROLL_INTO_VIEW`, `KEYBOARD_SET_MODE`) whose literal id no view of the class declares — the frontend finds nothing and the wire silently does nothing |
   | `denied-control-method` | a `CONTROL_BY_ID` wire naming a method the frontend denylist refuses (`destroy`, `setModel`, `bindProperty`, the generic reflection mutators) — the dispatch logs and returns, the control is never touched |
   | `binding-on-association` | a binding written into an *association* attribute — the XML parser takes the value as a control ID, never as a binding, so the association stays empty |
   | `unknown-model` | a `{name>…}` binding against a model the app does not have — abap2UI5 serves one default model plus `device>`/`message>`, and an unknown prefix leaves the property unset |
   | `date-type-without-source` | a `sap.ui.model.type.Date`/`DateTime`/`Time` binding with no `formatOptions.source` — the JSON model can only carry a string, so the type throws on every format |
   | `binding-type-mismatch` | an ABAP character field bound to a numeric/boolean property — it arrives as `"100"` where UI5 declared a float, which future mode rejects |
   | `missing-accessibility` | an icon-only `Button` with no accessible name (no `text`, `tooltip` or `ariaLabelledBy`), or an `Image` the author marked meaningful (`decorative="false"`) and left without `alt` — for a decorative image, which is UI5's **default**, `alt` is ignored by the framework |

   Bindings and expressions are never value-checked (their value is a
   runtime matter), custom namespaces stay out of scope, and a control
   whose inheritance chain leaves the snapshot is never reported as
   missing a member — no guessing.
   **abap2UI5-specific rules** — the defects that stay *silent* at runtime,
   which no UI5 tooling can see because they live in the relationship
   between the ABAP class and the view it builds:

   | Finding | Why it matters |
   | --- | --- |
   | `unknown-binding-path` | a hand-written `{/TYPO}` the derived model has no path for — the field just stays empty. Also judged inside complex binding infos (`path: '/TYPO'`) and expression bindings (`${/TYPO}`); a numeric segment steps into the bound table's row (`/T_ITEMS/9/TEXT`). Inside a bound aggregation a relative `{TYPO}` is resolved against the **row**, so a misspelled column field is caught too — but only where the row's shape is known from the class's `TYPES`, never guessed |
   | `binding-for-event` / `event-for-property` | `_bind( )` on an event (dead control) or `_event( )` on a property |
   | `non-released-api` | an abap2UI5 object outside the released `src/02` package. That package — `z2ui5_if_app`, `z2ui5_if_client`, `z2ui5_if_exit`, `z2ui5_cl_ui5_http_handler`, `z2ui5_cl_ui5_view_builder` — is the whole contract; the engine (`src/01`, "internal use only"), the renamed AJSON/S-RTTI/abap-util copies (`src/00`) and the frozen legacy package (`src/99`) carry no compatibility promise and announce no change: one upstream commit renamed the entire core layer *and* moved the old view builder and HTTP handler into the frozen package. Judged only against names the linter knows are framework objects, so your own `z2ui5_`-prefixed classes are never reported |
   | `obsolete-binder` | `client->_bind_edit( )` — superseded by `client->_bind( )`, which is two-way as well. A call carrying `custom_mapper_back`/`custom_filter_back` is reported too (they are accepted for source compatibility but no longer evaluated), only without the autofix |
   | `obsolete-model-update` | `view_model_update( )`, `nest_view_model_update( )`, `nest2_view_model_update( )`, `popup_model_update( )`, `popover_model_update( )` — **empty methods**: the framework compares the model before and after `main( )` and pushes it to every open slot by itself. The call reads as "the model is pushed here" where nothing happens; delete it |
   | `obsolete-frontend-event` | `client->_event_client( )` — superseded by `client->follow_up_action( )`. Since it gained a `RETURNING` parameter it reaches the same `get_event_client( )` wherever its result is consumed, so one method both schedules a frontend action and wires one |
   | `unconverted-abap-boolean` | an ABAP boolean written straight into the view: it arrives as `'X'`/`' '`, and UI5 reads any non-empty string as true — so `visible = abap_false` makes the control **visible**. The correction is the builder's own boolean parameter: `a( b = flag )` |
   | `binding-to-local` | a local variable bound: the instance is serialized across the roundtrip, the method stack is not, so the value is lost |
   | `binding-to-reference` | a `TYPE REF TO` attribute bound without dereferencing — the serializer walks DATA, not references, so the bind throws at runtime; write `client->_bind( ref->* )` |
   | `manual-init-flag` | a boolean attribute gating the first render — `client->check_on_init( )` already says whether this is the first run, without shipping a flag to the browser on every roundtrip |
   | `event-on-disabled-control` | an event handler on a control with a literal `enabled="false"` — the control can never fire, so the handler is dead (a hint: a 1:1 port of a disabled-state demo legitimately carries the original's handler) |
   | `binding-to-nonpublic` | a PROTECTED/PRIVATE attribute bound — only PUBLIC attributes are serialized into the model, so the first roundtrip fails with `BINDING_ERROR`; move it to the `PUBLIC SECTION` |
   | `ui5-internal-access` | `mProperties` & friends read from a wire or binding — private UI5 internals with no API contract, they change across UI5 patches without notice |
   | `commercial-ui5-host` | a URL pinned to `ui5.sap.com` / `*.hana.ondemand.com` — use `sdk.openui5.org`, or the app breaks on an OpenUI5-only landscape |
   | `view-never-displayed` | a view is built but never handed to the client — an empty page, no error |
   | `event-without-handler` | an event nothing reacts to — a dead control, *unless* the roundtrip alone is intended (so: a hint, never an error) |
   | `live-event-roundtrip` | a `liveChange` wired to `client->_event( )` — round-trips are serialized and an event fired while one is in flight is **dropped**, so the bound value lags under fast input; prefer a two-way binding or the final-value event (a hint: the wire converges when input pauses, and sometimes every keystroke genuinely must reach ABAP) |
   | `popover-anchor-unknown-id` | `popover_display( by_id = … )` naming an id no view declares — the fragment loads, finds no anchor and is destroyed again; nothing opens, nothing renders red |
   | `unknown-frontend-action` | a literal action name outside the frontend dispatch table (case-sensitive) — `execute` looks it up and does **nothing at all** on a miss, not even a console line. The `cs_event-` constants are compile-checked; this covers the literal spelling |
   | `unknown-view-slot` | a literal view slot outside `MAIN`/`NEST`/`NEST2`/`POPUP`/`POPOVER` (case-sensitive — `cs_view-nested` is `NEST`, not `NESTED`) — the wire addresses no view, and for `CONTROL_BY_ID` a wrong slot even suppresses the global id fallback |
   | `invalid-keyboard-shortcut` | a shortcut combo naming no non-modifier key (`Ctrl+Shift`) — logged once, never registered, every later keydown does nothing |
   | `invalid-action-payload` | a JSON payload the runtime silently downgrades: an `object`-kind method argument (`setSticky`, `setHiddenInPopin`, `setP13nData`) that is not valid JSON becomes `{}`, an unknown enum key in it is dropped by UI5, and a malformed `BINDING_CALL` filter-groups payload (or one missing its nesting level) is rejected with only a console line |
   | `json-bind-on-scalar-property` | `_bind( json = abap_true )` landing on a `string`/`int`/`float`/`boolean` property — the spliced JSON node is the wrong type there, and the splice is outbound-only, so an edit through a two-way binding is silently discarded; json is for `object`-typed properties |
   | `raw-javascript-to-frontend` | raw JavaScript shipped to the browser — `follow_up_action`'s escape hatch (a non-name `val` is inserted verbatim as `custom_js`), a hand-written handler string on an event attribute, or a `<script>` tag in an attribute value. The frontend is a renderer: behaviour travels as data (`cs_event-` actions, bindings), never as code |
   | `get-viewname-removed` | a read of `client->get( )-viewname`, removed from `ty_s_get` — no longer compiles, and nothing in a systemless pipeline says so before activation |
   | `invalid-frontend-action` | a frontend-action `t_arg` outside the set the runtime accepts — an unknown `CONTROL_GLOBAL` object or method, a `BINDING_CALL` method that is not `filter`/`sort`, or `CONTROL_BY_ID`'s obsolete empty view slot. The browser logs and does nothing |
   | `unescaped-brace-in-style` | literal CSS braces in a `<style>` block — the XMLView parser reads them as bindings and the view dies; write `\{` and `\}` |
   | `collapsed-brace-in-style` | the same escape written inside a `\|…\|` template — the template collapses `\{` to `{` before the builder sees it, so the view dies anyway; use a backtick literal |
   | `unused-public-attribute` | a PUBLIC attribute nothing in the class ever touches — only PUBLIC attributes are serialized, so it is shipped to the browser every roundtrip for nothing |
   | `event-arg-out-of-range` | `get_event_arg( n )` past the `t_arg` the event declares — the read comes back empty (a 500 in the transpiled runtime). Judged only for a literal index, inside the handler of an event the class raises itself |
   | `event-arg-unresolved` | a bare-brace `t_arg` literal (`` `{COL}` ``): the runtime sends it verbatim but only `$`-prefixed expressions are resolved by UI5, so `get_event_arg( )` receives an **empty** value with no error anywhere. Write `` `${COL}` `` (a template *starting* with a `{0}` placeholder is fine — that form is quoted) |
   | `trailing-empty-event-arg` | the LAST `t_arg` entry is empty. `get_t_arg` buffers an empty argument and flushes it only when a later non-empty one follows, so an empty entry between filled ones keeps its slot and a **trailing** one disappears — `get_event_arg( n )` for that position reads initial, with no error anywhere |
   | `json-literal-in-attribute` | a raw JSON object literal written into a view attribute. UI5 parses a leading `{` as a binding, so the JSON is read as a binding path and the attribute ends up **empty** — the classic way to lose an integration Card's manifest. Keep the JSON in the model and bind it |
   | `popover-display-val` | `popover_display( val = … )` does not compile — the parameter is `xml`, unlike `popup_display`'s `val`. Caught here because nothing in a systemless pipeline meets a compiler |
   | `escaped-brace-in-backtick` | a binding written `\{ … \}` inside a `backtick` literal — escaping is a |…| template rule, so the backslash survives into the attribute and UI5 never sees a binding |
   | `uncurated-formatter` | a `formatter: 'Formatter.…'` naming a function the framework's curated module does not export — UI5 resolves the string at binding time and an unknown name silently yields **no value**; compute it in ABAP and bind the finished field |
   | `hardcoded-binding-path` | an absolute binding path written as text (`{/PATH}`, `path: '/PATH'`) — derive it from `client->_bind( var )` so it moves with a variable rename; an OData entity path in a class that switches its default model is exempt |
   | `missing-view-display-on-navigated` | a `check_on_navigated( )` branch that never re-displays — after returning from a called app the browser keeps showing *that* app's view |
   | `chain-indentation` | a builder call whose indentation contradicts the tree it builds — a sibling at a different column than its siblings, or a call written left of the element it belongs to. A chain is the one thing nothing else formats (abaplint's `indentation` is off for exactly this reason), and the ABAP indentation is the only picture of the view's tree there is. The indent STEP is not judged, only that the chain keeps its own |
   | `chain-element-per-line` | several controls on one line of a multi-line chain — each is a level of the tree the indentation can no longer show. Only elements count: an attribute may share its control's line (`)->leaf( \`Text\` )->a( n = \`text\` … )`), and closing calls and one-line chains are exempt |
   | `separate-lifecycle-ifs` | lifecycle checks in separate `IF` blocks instead of one `IF`/`ELSEIF` chain — separate blocks can run more than one branch per roundtrip (a guard block that `RETURN`s is exclusive and fine) |
   | `duplicate-for-iterator` | the same `FOR` iterator name twice in one method — a 7.02 downport materializes each as `DATA <name> TYPE i` and fails activation |

The name in the left column is the **rule id**: it is printed at the end of
every reported line, it is the key in the `rules` block of the config file,
and it is what a source directive names. Every rule is documented one page
away — **[abap2ui5.github.io/linter](https://abap2ui5.github.io/linter/)**,
searchable, one anchor per id. Every finding also carries a
**severity**, a ready-made **message** and — where the gate could place it —
the **line and column** in the file it came from:

```
src/zcl_my_app.clas.abap
  20:9   error    a( n = `title` ) without an element to attach it to …            attribute-without-element
  31:18  error    text is set twice on the same control …                          duplicate-property
  44:22  warning  sap.m.GenericTile systemInfo is @since 1.92.0 …                   member-too-new
  51:35  hint     event NO_HANDLER is raised but never handled …                    event-without-handler

4 problems (2 errors, 1 warning, 1 hint)
abap2ui5-linter: 12 file(s), 1 failing, 0 skipped (target SAPUI5 1.71, metadata from 1.151.0, failing on warning)
```

Files with nothing to report are not printed.

| Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `error` | the app breaks: a dump, a control that will not load, a value UI5 rejects, or a defect that silently destroys the view |
| `warning` | it works where it was written, but not necessarily on the target system (version floor, deprecation) — or the data behind it is not what the author thinks it is |
| `hint` | worth knowing, never wrong by itself |

`--fail-on error|warning|hint|never` decides which of them break the build
(default `warning`; `--advisory` is `--fail-on never`). Everything is always
*reported* — the threshold only sets the exit code.

2. **Render gate** — the view is loaded with a real `XMLView.create` in
   headless Chromium against the OpenUI5 runtime served locally from the
   `@openui5/*` npm packages, with UI5 *future mode* active — so a typo'd
   property, an unknown control, a broken expression binding, or a strict
   property-type violation fails **before** the app ever reaches a system.

Input can be:

- **ABAP classes** building views with the generic builder
  `z2ui5_cl_ui5_view_builder` (`ele`/`tag`/`a`/`end`). The view XML is
  statically reconstructed from the builder calls, and a **typed mock model**
  is derived from the class's `TYPES`/`DATA`/`model_init` seeds, so bindings
  resolve realistically during the render.
- **Raw `*.view.xml` / `*.fragment.xml`** files.

  A directory is scanned by the abapGit naming convention (`*.clas.abap`,
  `*.view.xml`, `*.fragment.xml`); a file you NAME on the command line is
  checked whatever it is called, as long as it carries a builder chain.

## CLI

```

Installed, the binary is `abap2ui5-linter` — or `abap2ui5lint`, the short
spelling that matches the config file name.

| Exit code | |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | clean, or nothing above `--fail-on` |
| `1` | a finding at or above `--fail-on` (default: `warning`), or a render error |
| `2` | bad usage or a broken config file |

`--format` takes `stylish` (the default shown above), `json`, `markdown` and
`sarif`; `--json` is a shorthand for `--format json`. The SARIF log is what
GitHub code scanning ingests — upload it with `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`
and findings land in the Security tab and as native PR annotations. Inside
GitHub Actions every finding is additionally emitted as a workflow command
(alongside `stylish` only, so the machine formats stay parseable) —
`--no-annotate` turns that off, `--annotate` forces it on elsewhere.

## What a run says about itself

A finding list describes what is wrong. On a corpus that is clean — the state
a repo with a baseline lives in — it describes nothing at all, and "148 files,
no findings" reads identically whether two thousand controls were judged or
the reconstruction quietly produced empty views. So a run over more than one
file closes with what it **looked at**:

```
Success! No findings detected.

sources    148 app classes
views      172 documents reconstructed, nested 11 deep, 7 classes produced none
judged     2,176 controls of 106 types, 548 bindings, 69 icons, 4,164 attributes
most used  sap.m.Text 250, sap.m.Label 208, sap.m.Button 205, sap.m.Input 189, +102 more
gates      properties 148 files, render 172 documents
findings   none
baselined  476 findings suppressed by abap2ui5lint-baseline.json (chain-element-per-line 339, …)
time       properties 0.5s, render 13.0s, total 13.5s
abap2ui5-linter: 148 files, 0 failing, 0 skipped (target OpenUI5 1.71, metadata from 1.151.0, failing on warning)
```

`7 classes produced none` and a `judged` line of zeroes are the two readings
that say the gate is not seeing the corpus — the failure mode a green run
otherwise hides. `--stats` forces the block for a single file, `--no-stats`
drops it, `--format json` carries the same numbers under `stats` (per file
too, minus the control histogram), and `--format markdown` renders it as the
job summary a workflow writes into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

While the run is still going, the gates report on **stderr** — stdout stays
the report, so `--json | jq` is unaffected. On a terminal that is one
rewriting line; inside GitHub Actions it is one line per file inside a
collapsed group per gate, with the timing line outside it:

```
::group::abap2ui5-linter: render gate, 141 files on 4 browser pages
  [  1/141] src/01/z2ui5_cl_smp_app_004.clas.abap
  [  2/141] src/01/z2ui5_cl_smp_app_006.clas.abap — render skipped (built in helper methods)
::endgroup::
abap2ui5-linter: render gate — 141 files in 13.0s
```

Deliberately no finding counts in that log: at that moment the baseline and
the `rules` block have not had their say, so a fully baselined corpus would
log hundreds of findings and then report none. `--progress` / `--no-progress`
override where it is on (default: a terminal, and GitHub Actions).

## The badge

`--badge <file>` writes a [shields.io endpoint][endpoint] object for the run,
so a repository can show the state of its **corpus** in the README instead of
only whether some workflow exited zero:

```sh
node cli.mjs src --badge .github/badges/abap2ui5lint.json
```

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "label": "abap2UI5-linter",
  "message": "148 apps · UI5 1.71 · clean",
  "color": "4c1",
  "labelColor": "0a6ed1",
  "namedLogo": "sap",
  "logoColor": "white",
  "cacheSeconds": 3600
}
```

```md
[![abap2UI5-linter](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/.github/badges/abap2ui5lint.json)](https://github.com/abap2UI5/linter)
```

The message carries the size of the checked corpus, the UI5 floor it was
checked against, and the outcome (`clean`, `3 problems`, `7 errors`); the
colour follows the outcome. It is written on every run — a failing one
included, which is the run whose badge matters — before the exit code is
decided. Commit the file from the job that lints the pull request (that is
where the corpus changes) and the badge on the default branch updates when
that pull request merges; nothing needs to run on a schedule and no service
sees your repository.

`label`, `logo` (a [simple-icons] name, or `null` for none) and `labelColor`
are settable through the config's `badge` block, which is also where the file
belongs when every run should refresh it:

```jsonc
"badge": { "file": ".github/badges/abap2ui5lint.json", "label": "samples" }
```

## `--fix`

Seven rules carry an exact correction and are rewritten in place; the run
then reports what is left, so `--fix` can go in front of any other flag
(`--fix-dry-run` reports what it would change without writing a file).

| Rule | What `--fix` writes |
| --- | --- |
| `obsolete-binder` | `client->_bind_edit( … )` → `client->_bind( … )`, arguments untouched — except a call carrying `custom_mapper_back`/`custom_filter_back`, which is reported without a fix (the arguments have to go too, and dropping one is not a rename) |
| `obsolete-model-update` | the call is deleted, with its line when it has that line to itself; a shared line or a trailing comment keeps everything but the call |
| `obsolete-frontend-event` | `client->_event_client( … )` → `client->follow_up_action( … )`, arguments untouched |
| `unconverted-abap-boolean` | a bare token moved onto `a( b = … )` — an expression is left alone |
| `event-arg-unresolved` | the missing `$` inserted (`` `{COL}` `` → `` `${COL}` ``), a `\|…\|` template left alone |
| `popover-display-val` | `popover_display( val = … )` → `popover_display( xml = … )`, the argument untouched |
| `undeclared-namespace` | the missing `xmlns:` declaration inserted at the view root — for the conventional prefixes (`core`, `mvc`, `l`, `form`, `f`, `table`, `u`, `uxap`, `tnt`, `html`, `cc`) only; any other prefix could mean any library |

Nothing else is touched: a correction that has to guess (which of two
duplicate attributes survives, what event a `_bind` on an event slot meant to
raise) is worse than the finding it replaces. A rule waived by a directive or
by the config is never rewritten, and overlapping corrections are deferred to
the next run rather than merged. `ABAP2UI5LINT_FIX_DRY_RUN=true` reports what
it would change without writing a file.

## Waiving a rule

Three scopes, from narrow to wide:

**One line** — a comment in the source, spelled the way ui5lint spells it and
carried by whatever comment syntax the file has:

```abap
" abap2ui5lint-disable-next-line unknown-binding-path -- filled in a LOOP
)->a( n = `text` v = `{PRICE}`
```

```xml
<!-- abap2ui5lint-disable-next-line unknown-property -->
```

`-disable-line` waives the line the comment sits on, `-disable` … `-enable`
waives a block. Naming no rule waives every rule; everything after `--` is a
reason and is ignored — which is also what ends an XML comment, so the `-->`
is never read as a rule id.

**One repo** — the `rules` block of the config file (see below): switch a rule
off, give it another severity, or exclude files from it.

**One member** — `--allow sap.m.Avatar.displaySize` keeps using a control or
member that is newer than the floor, without touching the rule itself.

### Adopting the linter on an existing repo — the baseline

Switching a linter on over a grown codebase reports everything at once, and
the escapes above all lose information (`rules: false` drops the rule,
directives touch every line). The **baseline** freezes the debt instead:

```bash
npx abap2ui5-linter src --update-baseline     # writes abap2ui5lint-baseline.json
```

Commit that file and point the config at it (`"baseline":
"abap2ui5lint-baseline.json"`, or `--baseline <file>`). From then on the
frozen findings are suppressed (counted, never listed), **new** findings fail
normally — and an entry whose finding is gone is **stale and fails too**, so
the baseline only ever shrinks (rerun `--update-baseline` after fixing
things). Keys are line-free (`file|rule|control|member|value` with a count),
so moving code around does not invalidate them. Render errors are not
baselineable — `rules: { "render-error": { "exclude": […] } }` covers those.

### SAPUI5 or OpenUI5

`--distribution sapui5|openui5` (`--openui5` as a shorthand, setting
`abap2ui5.viewCheck.distribution` in the VS Code extension) says which
distribution the target system serves. SAPUI5 ships libraries OpenUI5 does
not — `sap.ui.comp` (Smart controls), `sap.suite.*`, `sap.ushell`, `sap.fe`,
`sap.viz`, … — so a SmartTable is perfectly fine on SAPUI5 and a guaranteed
runtime error on OpenUI5. With `openui5` those controls are reported as
`sapui5-only-control`; the default `sapui5` accepts them silently (they are
outside the snapshot either way, and are never mistaken for a typo).

### Which UI5 version is checked against

`--ui5 <version>` (alias `--min-ui5`, setting `abap2ui5.viewCheck.minUi5` in
the VS Code extension) is the version **your system runs**. It drives both
directions:

- a control or member introduced *after* it is a finding (it would not exist
  on your system),
- a deprecation is only reported once it is *in effect* at that version — a
  control deprecated as of 1.149 is silent for a 1.71 target.

The metadata itself comes from the snapshot in `data/properties.json`,
generated from the `@openui5/*` sources this repo pins (its version is
printed in the CLI summary and stored as `ui5Version`). Existence checks are
therefore made against that snapshot: a control **removed** in a later UI5
than your target cannot be distinguished from a typo, so keep the snapshot at
or above the versions you target.

## Configuration file — `abap2ui5lint.jsonc`

Pin the settings in the checked repo instead of repeating CLI flags — same
idea as `abaplint.jsonc`, and `abap2ui5lint.json` is discovered too.
Discovery is eslint-style: `--config <file>` wins, otherwise the file is
searched upward from the current directory and from each given path.
Precedence per option: explicit CLI flag > config file > built-in default
(`--no-config` ignores the file entirely).

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abap2UI5/linter/main/data/abap2ui5lint.schema.json",
  "paths": ["src"],          // used when the CLI got no positional paths
  "ui5": "1.71",             // UI5 floor for the property gate
  "distribution": "sapui5",  // or "openui5"
  "failOn": "warning",       // error | warning | hint | never
  "render": true,            // false = skip the render gate (--no-render)
  "allow": [],               // e.g. ["sap.m.Avatar.displaySize"]
  "baseline": "abap2ui5lint-baseline.json",  // adoption-time debt, see above
  "badge": ".github/badges/abap2ui5lint.json",  // shields endpoint, see above
  "rules": {
    "missing-accessibility": false,        // off
    "member-deprecated": "hint",           // another severity
    "event-without-handler": {             // both, plus file exclusions
      "severity": "warning",
      "exclude": ["/test/"]                // file regex, case insensitive
    },
    // the render gate's pseudo-rule: waive render failures per file instead
    // of render:false wholesale. A waived file that renders CLEAN is called
    // out as a stale waiver, so the exclusion cannot quietly outlive its bug.
    "render-error": { "exclude": ["legacy/"] }
  }
}
```

The `$schema` line gives editors completion and validation for every key and
every rule id — `data/abap2ui5lint.schema.json` is generated from the rule
registry, so it can never drift from the linter (`npm run generate-schema`).

Unknown keys — and unknown rule ids — fail loudly (typo protection). The
GitHub Action defers to the repo's config for every input you leave unset.

## GitHub Action

```yaml
jobs:
  lint-views:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: abap2UI5/linter@main
        with:
          paths: src
          min-ui5: '1.71'
          fail-on: warning
          badge: .github/badges/abap2ui5lint.json
          flags: '--allow sap.m.GenericTile.systemInfo'
```

Findings are annotated onto the pull request diff by default; set
`annotations: false` to keep the log plain. `badge` only writes the endpoint
file — committing it is the workflow's job, and the pull request that changes
the corpus is the right place to do it.

## Library

```js
import { checkFiles, checkAbapSource, checkXmlSource } from '@abap2ui5/linter';

const results = await checkFiles(['src/zcl_my_app.clas.abap']);
// -> [{ file, findings: [...], renderErrors, docs, model }]
//    finding: { type, control, member, severity, message, line, column, ... }
```

`checkFiles`/`checkAbapSource`/`checkXmlSource` annotate their findings
themselves and honour `rules` plus the source directives — pass `rules` (and,
for `exclude`, the `file` the source came from) in the options. Anything
driving the gates directly (`checkNodes`, `checkAbapRules`) gets the same from
the `findings` subpath, so severity and wording are never reinvented per
consumer:

```js
import { annotate, applyRules, applyDirectives, RULES, severityOf, describe }
  from '@abap2ui5/linter/findings';

annotate(findings, source);                       // severity, message, line, column
findings = applyRules(findings, rules, file);     // the repo's rules block
findings = applyDirectives(findings, source);     // abap2ui5lint-disable-* comments
```

`RULES` is the full rule-id registry. The `report` subpath holds the
formatters (`formatStylish`, `formatJson`, `formatMarkdown`,
`githubAnnotations`, `summarize`) if you want the same output elsewhere, plus
the run-summary and badge builders (`runStats`, `statsRows`, `formatStats`,
`badgeEndpoint`) and `createProgress`, the reporter behind the `onProgress`
callback `checkFiles` calls while it runs:

```js
const results = await checkFiles(files, {
  onProgress: ({ phase, done, total, file }) => { /* 'properties' | 'render' */ },
});
```

`--json` output carries the annotated findings plus a `totals` count per
severity, a `problems` total, and `stats` — what the run looked at (documents,
controls, bindings, icons, the control histogram), per file as well.

Consumers: the [ai-mcp](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ai-mcp) server exposes
these gates as MCP tools for AI coding agents; the
[VS Code extension](https://github.com/abap2UI5/vscode-extension) is the
natural place to surface findings as editor diagnostics.

## What it cannot do (by design)

- Event round-trips and visual/UX fidelity stay with a live run (see
  ai-mcp's `run_app`).
- A class that builds view parts in helper methods without the handle idiom is
  not statically reconstructable — the render gate is **skipped with a notice**
  (an incomplete reconstruction would validate the wrong view). The property
  gate still runs on what was reconstructed.
- Enum *values* newer than the floor are invisible at the member-name level;
  members without `@since` count as always-available (they predate version
  tracking).
- A model field the class fills **in code** (a `LOOP` in `model_init`) instead
  of in a literal seed has no static value. The render gate therefore only
  ever sees what a seed sets — inventing an empty string for such a field
  would have UI5's strict mode reject a perfectly good view (`state=""` is not
  a `ValueState`). The property gate asks a second, complete picture of the
  model instead: every declared field of every declared structure, so a
  binding path is judged against what a row *has*, not against what a seed
  happened to set.

## Data

`data/properties.json` is generated from the OpenUI5 control sources — per
control the parent, class-level `@since`/`@deprecated`, interfaces, the
default aggregation and every declared member with its type, plus the enum
tables. The `@openui5/*` packages this repo already depends on ship those
sources, so a plain regenerate needs no OpenUI5 clone:

```sh
npm run generate-metadata                              # from node_modules
OPENUI5_DIR=/path/to/openui5 npm run generate-metadata # from a checkout
```

Two more artefacts are generated from the rule registry in `lib/findings.mjs`
and the prose in `lib/rule-docs.mjs` — `npm test` fails while either is stale:

```sh
npm run generate-schema      # data/abap2ui5lint.schema.json — editor completion
npm run generate-rules-page  # docs/index.html — the published rule reference
```

## Credits

The reconstruction, mock-model derivation, render harness and property gate
were built and battle-tested in
[samples-controls](https://github.com/abap2UI5/samples-controls) (`scripts/render-smoke.mjs`,
`scripts/property-check.mjs`, `scripts/generate-properties.mjs`) against the
official UI5 demo kit corpus. This package is the corpus-independent
extraction.
