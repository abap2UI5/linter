# AGENTS.md — abap2UI5-linter

Single source of truth for agents working on the **abap2UI5 view linter** —
the standalone property + render gates for abap2UI5 views (`z2ui5_cl_ai_xml`
builder classes and `*.view.xml`/`*.fragment.xml`), usable as CLI, library
and GitHub Action, no SAP system required.

> This entire project is in **English**. Plain ESM JavaScript, Node >= 22,
> no TypeScript, no build step, no formatter — do not add any of those.

## Build & verify

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium   # BEFORE npm test - the first test uses the render gate
npm test                          # test/run.mjs, home-grown asserts, ~156 assertions
npm run generate-schema           # after adding a rule - the test gates the drift
npm run generate-rules-page       # ditto: docs/index.html, the published reference
node cli.mjs <files> --no-render  # fast property-gate-only loop while iterating
# settings can be pinned in the checked repo's abap2ui5lint.jsonc (lib/config.mjs;
# CLI flag > config > default; unknown keys and unknown rule ids fail loudly)
```

`npm test` fails with an unhelpful Chromium error after a bare `npm ci` —
the playwright install is mandatory, not optional. CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs exactly these steps on Node 22.

Changing a **severity, a finding type or the reconstructor** additionally
needs the consumers checked — `.github/workflows/downstream.yml` does that on
every PR, and the same thing runs locally against sibling checkouts:

```bash
.github/scripts/substitute-linter.sh . ../ai-demokit
(cd ../ai-demokit && node scripts/view-gates.mjs --strict --no-render)
```

## Scope — what the linter can and cannot see

- Input is **`z2ui5_cl_ai_xml` builder classes** (`collectFiles` picks ABAP
  files containing the literal `z2ui5_cl_ai_xml=>factory`) plus raw
  `*.view.xml` / `*.fragment.xml`. Classes built with the frozen
  `z2ui5_cl_xml_view` fluent builder are **silently skipped** — a design
  boundary, not a bug to fix in passing: the class is on its way out, and
  support for it was deliberately added and reverted once already. The way
  in for such a repo is to migrate it (as
  [cds-wrapper](https://github.com/abap2UI5-addons/cds-wrapper) did), not to
  teach the reconstructor a second builder.
- The knowledge bound is the committed metadata snapshot (see below): the
  gate cannot know about anything newer than its `ui5Version`.
- **One builder chain per document.** The reconstructor reads a chain as one
  ABAP statement; a chain **split across statements on the same handle**
  (`popover->open( … ).` then `popover->open( \`List\` )`) keeps its cursor at
  runtime but is re-rooted here, so the document comes out with two roots.
  It fails loudly (the render gate rejects it as native HTML content) rather
  than silently — but the fix is in the port: write one chain per view.

## Rule taxonomy — where each finding type is emitted

A finding's `type` **is its rule id** — printed at the end of every reported
line, keyed in the config's `rules` block, nameable in a source directive and
offered by the JSON schema. The registry is `SEVERITY_BY_TYPE` in
`lib/findings.mjs` (exported as `RULES`); a type missing from it is not a
known rule and the config will refuse it. Emit sites (grep the id to find the
exact line):

| Emitting file | Finding types |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/properties.mjs` | `unknown-control`, `control-too-new`, `control-deprecated`, `sapui5-only-control` (with `--distribution openui5`), `unknown-property`, `member-too-new`, `member-deprecated`, `event-parameter-too-new`, `unknown-event-parameter`, `invalid-property-value`, `unknown-aggregation`, `aggregation-in-aggregation`, `too-many-children`, `invalid-aggregation-child`, `duplicate-aggregation`, `missing-required-aggregation`, `duplicate-id`, `undeclared-namespace`, `invalid-expression-binding`, `binding-for-event`, `event-for-property`, `unknown-binding-path`, `collection-bound-to-property`, `binding-type-mismatch`, `uncurated-formatter` (list: `lib/formatters.mjs`), `missing-accessibility` |
| `lib/abap-rules.mjs` | `obsolete-binder`, `binding-to-local`, `unconverted-abap-boolean`, `event-without-handler`, `event-arg-unresolved`, `event-arg-out-of-range`, `invalid-frontend-action`, `unescaped-brace-in-style`, `collapsed-brace-in-style`, `unused-public-attribute`, `view-never-displayed`, `popover-display-val`, `hardcoded-binding-path`, `missing-view-display-on-navigated`, `separate-lifecycle-ifs`, `duplicate-for-iterator` |
| `lib/reconstruct.mjs` | `excess-shut`, `duplicate-property`, `attribute-without-element`, `display-root-mismatch`, `open-levels` (note-only) — via `prep.structure`, consumed in `lib/index.mjs` |
| `lib/render.mjs` | render-gate failures (real `XMLView.create` errors) |
| `lib/config.mjs` | no findings — the `abap2ui5lint.jsonc`/`.json` loader (discovery, validation, precedence, the `rules` block). New config keys go through its KNOWN set + a run.mjs assertion |
| `lib/findings.mjs` | no findings — the **severity/wording/position layer** (`severityOf`, `SEVERITIES`, `RULES`, messages) plus the two things a repo can say back to it: `applyRules` (the config's `rules` block) and `applyDirectives` (`abap2ui5lint-disable-*` comments). Every consumer (CLI, VS Code extension, ai-demokit `view-gates`, ai-mcp) reads what a finding *means* from here; a new finding type needs its severity classified here or consumers fall back to a default |
| `lib/report.mjs` | no findings — the **output layer**: `summarize`, the `stylish`/`json`/`markdown` formatters and the GitHub workflow-command annotations. The CLI only parses flags and picks one |

**A new rule moves five places together** — forgetting one has happened:

1. the emit site in `lib/`,
2. its severity in `SEVERITY_BY_TYPE` (`lib/findings.mjs`) — that is also what
   registers it as a rule id,
3. an entry in `RULE_DOCS` (`lib/rule-docs.mjs`) — category, summary, detail,
4. a fixture in `test/fixtures/` + assertions in `test/run.mjs`,
5. a row in the README finding-type table.

Then regenerate and commit both artefacts — `npm test` fails while either is
stale:

```bash
npm run generate-schema      # data/abap2ui5lint.schema.json
npm run generate-rules-page  # docs/index.html
```

`lib/frontend-actions.mjs` and `lib/formatters.mjs` are the two
**hand-maintained** knowledge files, and both are watched by
`scripts/check-upstream.mjs` (weekly via `upstream-sync.yml`, on drift an
issue): it re-derives the curated formatter exports and the `GLOBAL_TARGETS`
map from the abap2UI5 sources and fails on any difference — so an upstream
change becomes an issue here instead of a silent false positive at some
user's desk. On `lib/frontend-actions.mjs` in detail:
the closed whitelists `invalid-frontend-action` judges against. Its source of
truth is abap2UI5's `z2ui5_cl_app_frontendaction_js` — a JavaScript module
embedded in an ABAP string concatenation, which is not worth parsing, and
that repo is not a dependency here. Refresh it by reading `GLOBAL_TARGETS`
and `BINDING_METHODS` there. Kept in step 2026-08-02 with abap2UI5's new
`POPUP: setWithinArea` target (`sap.ui.core.Popup.setWithinArea`, @since
1.89) — a target added upstream is a **silent** breaking change here until
this file follows: the linter reports the correct new wire as an
`invalid-frontend-action`. Only **closed** sets belong in it: `CONTROL_BY_ID`
accepts any control method that does not match a deny prefix, so a whitelist
for it would report correct code.

A rule may also carry `fixes: [{ start, end, text }]` (see `lib/fix.mjs`):
exact spans in the source it was given, applied by `--fix`. Attach them only
when the correction is mechanical — a fix that has to guess is worse than a
finding that stays — and describe it in the rule's `fixNote`, which the test
requires for everything listed in `FIXABLE`.

## Deliberate kinship with ui5lint and abaplint

The audience is the audience of [UI5/linter](https://github.com/UI5/linter)
and [abaplint](https://github.com/abaplint/abaplint), so the surface is
theirs on purpose and a change that drifts from it needs a reason:

| Ours | Modelled on |
| --- | --- |
| `path` heading, `line:col severity message rule-id`, `N problems (…)`, `Success! No findings detected.` | ui5lint's stylish formatter |
| `--format stylish\|json\|markdown`, `--quiet`, `--version` | ui5lint |
| `--fix` plus a `*_FIX_DRY_RUN` env escape | ui5lint's `--fix` / `UI5LINT_FIX_DRY_RUN` |
| `abap2ui5lint-disable-next-line`/`-disable-line`/`-disable`/`-enable`, reason after `--` | ui5lint directives |
| `abap2ui5lint.jsonc`, `rules: { id: false \| severity \| { severity, exclude } }`, JSON schema for editor completion | abaplint's config and `BasicRuleConfig` |
| `docs/index.html` — one searchable page, one anchor per rule id | rules.abaplint.org |
| bin alias `abap2ui5lint`, exit codes 0/1/2 | both |
| workflow-command annotations on the PR diff | abaplint's `actions-abaplint` |

Known deliberate divergences: severities are `error/warning/hint` (not
abaplint's `Error/Warning/Info` — `hint` is already load-bearing across
consumers), and rule ids are kebab-case like ui5lint's rather than abaplint's
snake_case.

The former test-coverage debt (`invalid-aggregation-child`,
`sapui5-only-control`, `open-levels`) is worked off — every rule now has an
assertion, and the README finding tables (place 5 above) are gated by a
test that checks every rule id appears in them.

## Static-check roadmap — app knowledge that can still move into the gate

The mission is to encode as much app-building knowledge as possible as
static checks, so an agent learns a rule from a finding instead of a doc.
**The list distilled from the app guide and the ai-demokit gotchas is now
worked off**; every entry shipped:

| Roadmap entry | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Popup/view root mismatch | `display-root-mismatch` |
| Strictly-typed property bound to a character field | `binding-type-mismatch` |
| `get_event_arg( n )` beyond the declared arity | `event-arg-out-of-range` |
| Frontend-action wire tokens | `invalid-frontend-action` (+ `lib/frontend-actions.mjs`) |
| Collapsed-brace expression bindings | `collapsed-brace-in-style`, alongside `unescaped-brace-in-style` |
| Unbound PUBLIC attribute | `unused-public-attribute` |
| Date/time model type without a `source` format | `date-type-without-source` |
| `CONTROL_BY_ID` naming an id no view declares | `frontend-action-unknown-id` |
| Relative binding on a control with no binding context | `relative-binding-without-context` |
| `CONTROL_BY_ID` `set…( )` on a bindable property | `settable-property-via-action` |

The last one shipped **narrower than it was written**: "no view binds it" is
not the same as dead. A PUBLIC attribute used only in ABAP code is state, not
ballast — PUBLIC is precisely how a value survives the roundtrip — so only a
name that appears once in the whole class, its own declaration, is reported.
Keep that distinction if the rule is ever widened.

The `date-type-without-source` entry came from the ai-demokit port of
`sap.ui.core.sample.TypeDateAsDate` (app 282): its JSON model holds a JS
`Date`, which an ABAP-fed model can never carry, so the port has to add
`formatOptions.source` to every binding. Neither the property gate (the
member exists) nor the render gate (it mocks the model) can see the
omission — a static read of the binding-info string can.

`frontend-action-unknown-id` came from the same batch (app 284, a
`navigateBack` on a MessageView that lives in the popup slot): the id is
the only part of a `CONTROL_BY_ID` wire nothing validated, and a wrong one
is silent in exactly the way the whole rule family exists for. It is
deliberately narrow — the id set is trusted only when EVERY `id`
attribute of the class is a literal, so a class that builds ids at
runtime is not judged at all.

`relative-binding-without-context` closes the **flattened-element-binding**
trap the ai-demokit porting guide could until now only describe as a manual
audit ("a `_bind`-less `` v = `{FIELD}` `` whose FIELD is a root-level DATA
scalar") — seven of its ports had shipped the wrong form. It needed a third
view of the class: the model and the shape only carry BOUND variables, so
`prepareAbap` now also returns `rootFields`, every attribute the class
declares. And it is the textbook case for the corpus rule below — the first
version reported four bindings in `sap.ui.table` **column templates**, which
are cloned per row and get their context from the table's `rows` binding in a
sibling aggregation. The corpus was right; the rule now treats any
`template` aggregation as a row context.

`settable-property-via-action` needed a THIRD input the ABAP-side rules did
not have: what the id in a wire actually is. `collectControlIds` +
`memberSection` / `propertyDecl` are exported from `properties.mjs` for it,
and `checkAbapRules` now takes `{ data, controlIds }` — with neither, the
rule simply stays silent. Its whole precision lives in the metadata: an
**association** (`selectedSection`) and a **function-typed** property
(`MessagePopover.asyncURLHandler`) can never be bound, so both are excluded
rather than reported and excused. It found five real ports on the corpus,
all five converted to bindings.

The 2026-08 round promoted the corpus-independent half of ai-demokit's
`pattern-lint.mjs` into real rules, so every consumer sees them instead of
one repo's gate script:

| Origin | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| pattern-lint `popover-display-val` (hold-out probes 607/613/617) | `popover-display-val`, with a `--fix` |
| pattern-lint `uncurated-formatter` (formatter pack removed upstream) | `uncurated-formatter` + `lib/formatters.mjs`, the hand-maintained curated list — the render harness mirrors it, a test keeps the two in step |
| pattern-lint `hardcoded-binding-path` (samples 456/457 human find) | `hardcoded-binding-path`, with the OData-entity-path and `<style>`-span exemptions |
| pattern-lint `duplicate-for-iterator` (app 234) | `duplicate-for-iterator` |
| app-guide lifecycle chapter | `separate-lifecycle-ifs` (guard blocks that RETURN are exempt — the linter's own `good` fixture is the precedent) and `missing-view-display-on-navigated` |
| snapshot params were complete all along | `unknown-event-parameter` — existence per event, but only for an event the control declares ITSELF: the first corpus run flagged `DateRangeSelection change` reading `from`/`to`/`valid`, which the metadata declares on `InputBase` with only `value` — a subclass can widen an inherited event without redeclaring it |

The corpus rules stay in pattern-lint only where they encode CORPUS policy
(method order, formatting, sidecar headers) — those do not belong here.

The second 2026-08-04 round added, each corpus-measured first:

| Origin | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| ai-demokit app 043's live BINDING_ERROR (found by the e2e interaction that closed its LIVE_TEST) | `binding-to-nonpublic` — only PUBLIC attributes are serialized, a bound PROTECTED one fails the first roundtrip |
| ai-demokit's documented residual gap ("enum values newer than 1.71 are invisible") | `enum-value-too-new` + the generator's `enumSince` map — its first corpus run confirmed the two hand-written POST_171 declarations on app 028 (`GenericTile frameType` OneByHalf/TwoByHalf @1.83) |
| the last two generic pattern-lint rules | `ui5-internal-access` (mProperties & friends), `commercial-ui5-host` |
| `hardcoded-binding-path` said "don't", nothing said "does it exist" | `unknown-binding-path` now also judges `path: '/X'` in complex binding infos and `${/X}` in expressions — the first corpus run found the row-index trap (`/T_ITEMS/9/TEXT` is legal; numeric segments now step into the bound table's row) |

Also in that round: `undeclared-namespace` gained a `--fix` for the
conventional prefixes, `--format sarif`, the adoption **baseline**
(`--update-baseline`, stale entries FAIL), a page POOL in the render gate
(`openRenderer({ pages })`, `checkFiles` uses 4 — the corpus render wall
clock divides accordingly), and `scripts/check-upstream.mjs` +
`upstream-sync.yml`, the weekly drift gate for the two hand-maintained
knowledge files below.

New candidates go here as they are found. Two rules of the trade the last
rounds established, before anything is added:

**A corpus run also measures the RECONSTRUCTOR, not only the rule.** The
`relative-binding-without-context` round found two model defects that had
been invisible because they cancel each other out: a `DATA t_x TYPE
ty_t_x.` (a **named** table type, not the inline `STANDARD TABLE OF`
form) was modelled as a **scalar**, so the render gate silently rendered
an empty aggregation and never instantiated the template — and fixing
that surfaced the second one, an **unseeded** table being given an
invented all-empty row, which the render gate then rejects on the first
enum or date property (`"" is of type string, expected sap.m.AvatarShape`).
Now: unseeded tables are empty for the renderer and a declared row in the
shape, the same split the scalars already had.

**Measure a new rule against the ai-demokit corpus before shipping it.**
`node cli.mjs /path/to/ai-demokit/src --no-render --json` over 282 real
ports, diffed per finding type against `main`, is what caught three separate
false-positive shapes: an event raised by a `message_box_display( onclose = )`
callback rather than `client->_event( )`, dispatch leaking across an
`ENDMETHOD`, and a `<style>` check scoped to the ABAP *statement* — which on
a builder chain is the entire view. A rule that lights up the corpus is
usually wrong before the corpus is.

**And check the rule can see anything at all.** Zero findings on the corpus
proves nothing on its own: `unused-public-attribute` was verified by
injecting a dead attribute into a real port (caught) and by counting what it
judges in silence (120 PUBLIC declarations across 37 of 60 sampled ports, all
correctly referenced). A rule that parses nothing is also a rule that reports
nothing.

## `data/properties.json` is generated — never hand-edit

The 468 KB one-line snapshot (`ui5Version` 1.151.0, 988 controls, 219
enums) is generated from the installed `@openui5/*` packages (or
`OPENUI5_DIR`) by:

```bash
npm run generate-metadata
```

Regenerate it **only** when bumping the `@openui5/*` pins in `package.json`
(or when the generator itself changes shape), and commit both together. The
drift gate (`generate-metadata --check`) runs **inside `npm test`**: the
generation dropped from ~3 minutes to ~2 seconds when the unanchored
`(\w+)\.extend\(` scan — 167 of those 172 seconds — was replaced by a
literal-anchored one (`extendHits`). The snapshot's version bounds what the
gate can know (reasoning in the README).

**Keep the pins on the latest published `@openui5` line.** The floor the gate
checks against (`minUi5`, default 1.71) is a *separate* parameter, so a bump
does not change a single verdict on existing code — measured on the ai-demokit
corpus, the 1.150 → 1.151 bump produced **0 new findings across 339 ports**.
What it does change is what a member *newer than the pin* reports as. A member
above the floor but below the pin is `member-too-new` / `control-too-new` /
`event-parameter-too-new` / `enum-value-too-new` — verdicts a consumer can
knowingly accept (ai-demokit's `POST_171` deviations excuse exactly those). A
member above the *pin* does not exist in the snapshot at all and degrades into
`unknown-control` / `unknown-property` / `unknown-aggregation` — "typo?" — plus
a `render` load failure, and **no consumer can excuse those**: they are the
shape a real typo has. So a stale pin does not under-report, it *mis*-reports,
and it blocks every consumer building on a control released after it
(`sap.tnt.SideNavigationSearchField` @1.151 was the case that surfaced this).
Bumping is one PR: the pins, `npm install`, `npm run generate-metadata`, and
the snapshot header numbers above.

**The generator is published with the package** (`files[]`) and takes
`--out <file>`, because it is the ecosystem's ONLY UI5 metadata parser.
ai-demokit used to carry a second one; the two drifted, and the other one was
wrong — it attributed a file-level `@deprecated` JSDoc block sitting on a local
variable to the CONTROL, marking `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` and
`sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage` deprecated when neither class doc says so. Its
`generate_result` workflow now runs this generator instead:

```bash
OPENUI5_DIR=./openui5 node node_modules/@abap2ui5/linter/scripts/generate-metadata.mjs \
  --out ui5/properties.json
```

Note what that does **not** mean: ai-demokit does not reuse `data/properties.json`
itself. It builds its sample universe from an OpenUI5 *checkout* that can be
newer than the `@openui5` packages pinned here (1.152 vs 1.151 at the time of
writing, and npm has no 1.152), and a snapshot older than the universe loses
the `@since` of controls introduced in between — `scopeOf` then reads them as
in scope (`sap.f.HeroBanner` @1.152 is the live example). So: **one generator,
two invocations**, each at the version its own consumer needs. Keep the
generator's output shape additive for the same reason the `--json` shape is
frozen — ai-demokit's coverage docs read `controls[…].since` / `.deprecated`.

## Release model — merging to main IS a release

- There is **no npm publish**; consumers install from git
  (`github:abap2UI5/linter`). `package.json` stays at its version.
- **`docs/index.html` is published on merge** to
  https://abap2ui5.github.io/linter/ by `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — a
  reworded rule detail is live the moment it lands on main. The workflow only
  serves the committed file, it never regenerates it: a generator running in
  CI would paper over a stale commit instead of failing on it. Pages has to be
  enabled once in the repository settings, source "GitHub Actions".
- `.github/workflows/bundle.yml` maintains the rolling prerelease tag
  **`render-gate-bundle`** with `view-check-bundle.tgz` (cli + lib + data +
  prod node_modules). **Installed VS Code extensions download this bundle at
  runtime** (`vscode-extension/src/rendergate.ts`) — merging a change to
  `cli.mjs`, `lib/`, `data/` or `package.json` silently updates what every
  installed extension fetches next. There is no version negotiation; treat
  `lib/` layout and CLI flags as a public contract. The **`--json` shape is
  part of that contract** — it may grow keys (`problems` was added that way),
  never lose or rename them. The human `stylish` output is not: it is for
  people, and it changed shape once already.
- The VS Code extension additionally pins a **linter commit SHA** in its
  `package-lock.json` for the bundled property gate — a new finding type is
  invisible in the editor until that lock is bumped there.
- **`abap2ui5lint.jsonc` is honoured by the CLI, the Action AND the VS Code
  extension** — the extension discovers it via `findConfigFrom`/`loadConfig`
  from `@abap2ui5/linter/config` and lets it beat the VS Code settings
  ("that is what CI checks against", its `src/lintconfig.ts`). The editor/CI
  divergence this bullet used to describe is closed; keep the config loader
  backward compatible, three consumers read it now.

## Relation to ai-demokit — this repo is canonical now

ai-demokit's ancestor scripts (`property-check.mjs`, `structure-lint.mjs`,
`render-smoke.mjs`) were **deleted** when its gates were consolidated onto
this linter: ai-demokit consumes `@abap2ui5/linter` as a git npm dependency
and keeps only the corpus policy in its `scripts/view-gates.mjs` (which
ports, POST_171 deviations, declared skips, advisories). Rules of thumb:

- **All generic view-checking logic lives here**; ai-demokit-specific gate
  policy (sidecar deviations, corpus conventions) stays in `view-gates.mjs`.
- A behaviour change here changes ai-demokit's CI verdicts on the next
  dependency bump. **`.github/workflows/downstream.yml` runs that check for
  you** on every push and PR — see below; you no longer have to remember to
  run the corpus by hand.
- Both consumers pin this repo by **commit SHA**
  (`github:abap2UI5/linter#<sha>`), so a merge here never moves them on its
  own; bumping the pin is a deliberate change in the consumer, and the
  downstream workflow is what says whether that bump is safe. A pin pointing
  at a **feature branch** of this repo is only ever temporary — it must become
  a SHA on main before that consumer's change is merged.

## The downstream contract — `.github/workflows/downstream.yml`

`npm test` only ever proves this linter against its own fixtures. The
downstream workflow proves it against the repos that actually consume it,
with **this checkout substituted for the SHA they pin**
(`.github/scripts/substitute-linter.sh` copies the published `files[]` over
`node_modules/@abap2ui5/linter`; the linter's own runtime deps stay hoisted in
the consumer, so no second install is needed):

| Job | What it catches |
| --- | --- |
| `ai-demokit corpus (280 ports)` | a rule that starts firing on real ports — run through `view-gates.mjs`, so corpus policy (POST_171 deviations, declared skips, advisories) applies and only a genuine regression fails |
| `vscode-extension typecheck` | a renamed or reshaped export — the extension imports the subpath exports against hand-written typings in its `src/linter.d.ts`, which nothing here would otherwise exercise |

A red downstream job is **not automatically a defect in the change**: a new
rule that fires on the corpus may well be right. It means the rollout has to
be decided — severity, an advisory period, or a corpus fix — rather than
landing unseen. Two traps worth knowing before reading a result:

- **Severity is not the whole story.** `view-gates.mjs` neutralises some rules
  by *type* (`ADVISORY_TYPES`), so raising one of those from `hint` to `error`
  changes nothing downstream. Conversely a **renamed rule id** is a silent
  breaking change: the consumer matches `VERSION_TYPES` and its sidecar
  deviations by type name, so a rename un-excuses every finding that name
  covered (renaming `member-too-new` fails 68 ports).
- The corpus exercises only a fraction of the rule set — as of this writing
  just six finding types fire across all 280 ports. A green corpus job means
  *no regression*, not *the new rule is covered*.
